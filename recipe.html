       <h3>Instructions</h3>
       <li>Using the stovetop, cook berries and xylitol with half an inch of water in a large pot. Bring to a rapid simmer for 20 minutes, then reduce and slowly simmer until liquid is reduced and berries have thickened.</li>
       <li>Once berries are cooked, taste a bit on a spoon. Add more xylitol if you want it sweeter.</li>
      	<li>Stir in lemon juice, balsalmic vinegar, and chia seeds. (You won't notice the chia seeds in the finished product because of the seeds in the strawberries.)</li>
      	<li>Ladle into jars, and store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, the freezer for up to a year, or use the traditional hot-water canning method to preserve jam for your pantry. </li>
